# PicoW-Proxy

This repository contains an small implementation of a working proxy server, that can be used to run on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
As the thread library is at the moment of writing this repository rather experimental, the originally thought of implementation is commented out and a simpler, not that much object oriented implementation is currently used.
However, the proxy is doing its job.
